# Diffusion Models for Multiple Table Data Overview

## Introduction
This folder contains the code implementation of ClavaDDPM, one of the most recent methods to use diffusion-based generative models for multi-relation tabular data generation. We provide Jupyter notebook demos to showcase its usage, including data loading, model training, sampling, and metrics computation.

## Notebook
Here you will find the main Jupyter notebooks
1. **ClavaDDPM** - This notebook covers the implementation of the ClavaDDPM algorithm for multi-relation tabular data synthesis. It includes a brief description of the algorithm, its implementation, and a demonstration of how to use it for sampling synthetic data and evaluating the quality of the synthetic data.
2. **evaluate_synthetic_data** - This notebook covers the evaluation of synthetic data generated by ClavaDDPM for single tables. To assess the quality of the synthetic data, we report various evaluation metrics, including low-dimensional statistics, high-dimensional statistics, evaluation of the synthetic data on downstream tasks, and privacy metrics. This notebook includes a brief description of these evaluation metrics, their implementation, and a demonstration of how to use them to evaluate the quality of synthetic data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the materials in this topic:
1. Ensure you have followed the reference to the installation guide and environment setup in the `README` file.
2. Run the notebook `ClavaDDPM.ipynb` to learn about the ClavaDDPM algorithm and its implementation step by step.
3. Finally using the notebook `evaluate_synthetic_data.ipynb` to evaluate the synthetic data generated by ClavaDDPM algorithm.
