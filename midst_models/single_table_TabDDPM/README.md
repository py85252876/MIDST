# TabDDPM for Single Table Data Overview

## Introduction
This folder contains the implementation of ClavaDDPM, a recent method that employs diffusion-based generative models for multi-relational tabular data generation. When configured for single-table synthesis, it leverages the TabDDPM implementation. The provided Jupyter notebooks and code examples focus on single-table scenarios, guiding you through data loading, model training, sampling, and metrics computation.

## Notebooks
Here you will find the following Jupyter notebooks:
1. **TabDDPM** - This notebook covers the tabddpm implementation for single table synthesis. It includes a brief description of the algorithm, its implementation, and a demonstration of how to use it for sampling synthetic data.
2. **evaluate_synthetic_data** - This notebook covers the evaluation of synthetic data generated by TabDDPM. In order to assess the quality of synthetic data, we report various evaluation metrics including low-dimensional statistics, high-dimensional statistics, evaluation of the synthetic data on downstream tasks and privacy metrics. This notebook includes a brief description of these evaluation metrics, their implementation, and a demonstration of how to use them to evaluate the quality of synthetic data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the materials in this topic:
1. Ensure you have followed the reference to the installation guide and environment setup in the `README` file.
2. Run the notebook `TabDDPM.ipynb` to learn about the ClavaDDPM algorithm and its implementation step by step.
3. Finally using the notebook `evaluate_synthetic_data.ipynb` to evaluate the synthetic data generated by TabDDPM algorithm.
